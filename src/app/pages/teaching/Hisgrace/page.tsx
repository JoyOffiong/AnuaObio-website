          <p>
            God`s plan to redeem man through the church of His son, Jesus Christ
            was not an after thought as some people may think. It was His plan
            for eternal purpose. Some people think that God kept Adam and Eve in
            the Garden of Eden and when they disobeyed God by disobeying Him,
            God then proposed an alternative plan to redeem man through the
            church. Such thinking denies God of one of His attributes which is
            that God is all knowing - omniscient. What is true and in conformity
            with Paul`s teaching in the scriptures is that before the creation,
            of the world, God had planned and predestined that the church would
            be chosen out of the world for eternal dwelling with Him at the end
            of time. That it would be that group (the church) that would be
            purified through the sacrificial offering of the `incarnate son``
            Jesus Christ. That in order to be chosen among the purified group,
            one must be a part of the church through obedience to the Gospel. As
            many as do so become sons of God and are thus destined to Heaven.

            B. Biblical Teachings on God`s Plan to Redeem Man
          </p>
          <p>
            Gen. 3:15 - tells us of the `seed of the woman who would bruise the
            head of the serpent while the serpent would bruise her heels. The
            seed of the woman of course refers to Jesus Christ. Apostle Paul
            records the fulfilment of this promise of God in Gal.4:4. `But when
            the time had fully come, His sent His son born of a woman, born
            under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive
            the full rights of sons; And as sons, God sent the spirit of His son
            into our heart crying `Abba` Father, and as sons we are heirs
            through Christ. Jesus, Himself said in Jn. 10:10, 28Vs 10: the thief
            comes only to steal kill and destroy. I have come in order that you
            might have life, life in its fullness. V28 says “I give them eternal
            life and they shall never perish no one can snatch them from my
            hand.” Again in Mark. 10:42, Jesus said `For even the son of man did
            not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom
            for many.” Jesus is truly the author of eternal life through his
            church.

            Prophesies Concerning The Establishment of The Church
          </span>
          <br />
          <p>
            Prophets Isaiah, Micah, and Zechariah (see Isa. 2:23; Mic.4:1-2 &
            Zec. 1:6) mentioned the place where the church will be built, which
            is Jerusalem. Micah and Isaiah mentioned the last days. The last
            days here refer to the period from the first Pentecost after the
            resurrection of Christ till the end of the world. Daniel, in Dan.
            2:44 prophesied that in the days of those kings, will the God of
            Heaven set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. Historically
            the last of those kingdoms was the Roman Empire under which the
            Church was established. The preceding kingdoms were Babylonian,
            Medo-Persian and Greek empires. Jesus was more specific about the
            time he told his disciples in Mk.9:1. He said, “I tell you the
            truth, some of who are standing here will not taste of death till
            they see the kingdom of God come with power”. Indeed, all the
            disciples were there except Judas Iscariot who was replaced by
            Mathias, when the kingdom of God came with power on the day of
            Pentecost. That was the establishment of the Church.
          </p>
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold ">The Day of Pentecost</span>
          <br />
          <p>
            The event of the day of Pentecost was as earlier prophesied by
            Prophet Joel, in Joel 2:28. On that day, the promised Holy Spirit
            came upon the Apostles and they began to speak in tongues in the
            native language of the Jews who were assembled for the feast of
            Pentecost. In the midst of wondering by some and mockery by others,
            Apostle Peter stood up and confirmed that what they saw was the
            fulfillment of Prophet Joel&apos;s prophecy concerning the outpouring of
            the Holt spirit on all flesh. The main thrust of his sermon was to
            tell the Jews that Jesus Christ whom you crucified was raised from
            the dead and was seated at the right hand of God the Father, and
            that Jesus is now Lord and Christ. Pricked in their hearts on
            hearing this, they asked Peter and the rest of the Apostle `Brethren
            what must we do? The reply from Peter and the others was, “Repent
            and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus for the
            remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
            Spirit.” (Acts 2:41). Those who gladly received the word were
            baptized and on that day, about 3,000 souls were baptized and added
            to them. That marked the establishment of the Lord`s church in
            Jerusalem. Acts 2:47 says “And the Lord added to the church daily,
            such as should be saved.” However, when persecution against the
            church which was in Jerusalem broke out, the disciples were
            scattered throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria except the
            apostles. It is quite commendable that those who were scattered went
            everywhere preaching the word of God. This was a fulfilment of the
            Lord`ss statement to the Apostles (Acts 1:8) “And ye shall be my
            witness in Jerusalem and in Judaea, in Samaria and to the uttermost
            part of the earth. The early disciples took the great commission
            given by Jesus in Matt 28:19 and Mark 16:15-16, seriously, such that
            Apostle Paul told the Colossians that the gospel had to be preached
            to every creature under the heaven. (Col 1:23). We will assume Paul
            was referring this to the then known world, because the gospel is
            yet to be preached to every creature under heaven of the present
            world. Whatever is left of the work of evangelism is for us and our
            posterity.{" "}

          <span className="font-bold "> Edifying role of the church </span>
          <br />
          <p>
            Edifying members means building them up to grow towards perfection.
            In Eph.4:11, Jesus Christ instituted in the church certain officers
            - Apostles, Prophets, Evangelist, Teachers, and Pastors for the
            equipping of saints for the work of the ministry and for the work of
            the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ; Till we all
            come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God,
            to a perfect man - to the stature of the fullness of Christ. God
            does not tolerate half-baked Christians. That is why the Holy Spirit
            inspired the Apostle to write the epistles to admonish the
            Christians and warn them about the consequences of sins if they want
            to make heaven.

          <p className="font-bold text-lg"> CONCLUSION </p>
          <p>
            As the church serve as a grooming ground in the process of selecting
            candidates for heaven, she has to purify herself for Jesus as the
            head of the Church to present her to himself as a glorious church
            and for individual Christians to also purify themselves so as to
            spend eternity with Jesus and therefore make the purpose of God. The
            purpose of God is the redemption of man through the Church. Be in
            the Kingdom of God, the Body of Christ, The Church of Christ, for
            which Christ is the Head (Col.1:18) for this to be accomplished. May
            God help us, and the rest of to heed to His calling and remain
            faithful to this calling, in Jesus name. Amen.
