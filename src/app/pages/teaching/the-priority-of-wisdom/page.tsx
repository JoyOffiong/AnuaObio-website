          <p>
            •In this section of verses, a father seeks to instil wisdom within
            his son, wisdom that he himself received from his father. The
            chapter begins with an appeal to children from a father, reminding
            them that what he teaches was earlier taught to him by his own
            father. Among the lessons imparted by the grandfather are these
            words of wisdom (Proverbs 4:4-7). Here, Solomon recounts how his
            father, David, encouraged him to seek wisdom when he was young.
            Solomon represents the father who tells his son, &quot;I have taught
            you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in the right paths&quot;
            (Proverbs 4:11).

           <p className="font-bold text-md">I. Exhortation to Embrace Wisdom:</p>
          <p>
           Children who receive proper instruction from faithful parents are promised a long life. The wise man said, &quot;And the years of your life shall be many&quot; (4:10). Notice the signs of love in the parents&rsquo; advice in Proverbs 4:1-4. The father continues to emphasise the importance of gaining wisdom and understanding, pleading with the child to listen, hear, and remember. &quot;Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, and give attention to know understanding. For I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law&quot; (Proverbs 4:2). Parents desire their children to thrive with wisdom, which increases the chances of success. 
            <br />
         &quot;Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of your life will be many&quot; (Proverbs 4:10). This proverb speaks of life: survival, avoiding problems, and overcoming the obstacles along the path. &quot;Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life&quot; (Proverbs 4:13).

           II. Supremacy of Wisdom:.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
           &quot;Get wisdom. Get understanding. Do not forget it, nor turn away from the words of my mouth. Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you. Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom. And with all your acquiring, get understanding. Exalt her, and she will promote you; she will bring you honour when you embrace her. She will give you a crown of glory&quot; (Proverbs 4:5-9). 
          </p>
         
          <p>Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding are closely connected; they are the offspring of the same parents. It takes wisdom to pursue knowledge, and the ability to apply knowledge correctly is what we call understanding. The proverbs state that wisdom is supreme and the first thing one should seek. Knowledge of God and His words is emphasised throughout the Bible. The moment you gain insight into a matter is the moment you begin to escape the path of ignorance and bondage. A wise person is a knowledgeable person.
          </p>
          <p>Verses 4-7 describe what wisdom is and emphasise the need for loyalty to it.  </p>

            Knowledge is God&apos;s instrument of deliverance. The proverbs further identify the advantages of being wise. A person who uses his intelligence, along with guidance received from trusting in the Lord, holds a significant advantage, even when facing overwhelming odds, like a fortified city. In Ecclesiastes, Solomon notes that wisdom is better than strength and weapons (Ecclesiastes 9:16-18).  
          </p>
        
          <p>
           We read in Proverbs 21:22, &quot;A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.&quot; The city represents a stronghold, heavily fortified with walls and towers. Verse 2:2a concludes the story, where he succeeds in bringing down this stronghold. This illustrates that a man who relies on God for wisdom is stronger than any man-made fortification. The inhabitants of the city place their trust in their walls and soldiers for various reasons; however, they would have fared better by trusting in the Lord, who can protect His people without walls or soldiers. This is what the wise man does, leading to his victory. Everyone who trusts in the Lord and His wisdom will be equally blessed. We read in Proverbs 24:14, &quot;Know that wisdom is this for your soul; if you find it, then there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.&quot; If a person discovers wisdom, it will provide a favourable future for him, and his hope will remain intact.
          </p>

          <p>Throughout Proverbs, Solomon encourages us to be wise. A wise son heeds the admonition to seek wisdom, allowing the father to see his son making choices and decisions based on sound information found in God&apos;s word. When a father has a son who lives according to this standard, he will rejoice greatly. We are reminded that these proverbs are designed to help individuals become wise and avoid the foolish mistakes made by the ungodly.</p>

            &quot;Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord&apos;s will is.  &quot;
