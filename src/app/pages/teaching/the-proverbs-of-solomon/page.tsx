          <p>
            •Solomon is the writer of the next three books of the bible:
            Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. Proverbs is the book on
            wisdom, Ecclesiastes is the book on love. Proverbs opens with the
            word, &quot;The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of
            Israel&quot; (1:1). Although the book begins with its title
            ascribing the proverbs to Solomon, it is clear from later chapters
            that he was not the only Author of the book. Proverbs 22:17 refers
            to the &quot;sayings of the wise&quot; and 24:23 mentions additional
            &quot;sayings of the wise&quot;. The presence of an introduction in
            22:17-21 further shows that these sections stem from a circle of
            wise men, not from Solomon himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            •Chapter 30 is attributed to Agur, son of Takeh, and 31:1-9 to King
            Lemuel, neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere. Most of the book,
            however is closely linked with Solomon. The headings in chapter 10:1
            and in 25:1 include his name, though 25:1 states that these proverbs
            were &quot;compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah&quot;. This
            indicates that a group of wise men or scribes compiled these
            proverbs as editors and added chapters 25-29 to the earlier
            collections. Solomon&apos;s ability to produce proverbs is specified
            in 1kings 4:32 where 3000 proverbs and 1005 songs are attributed to
            him. Since most of the proverbs were written by Solomon, they would
            have been written during his reign from 970-930BC. Proverbs receives
            its name from the nature of the content. It is a book of wisdom that
            was written in proverbs. The book of Proverbs can also be called the
            book of wisdom.

          <p className="font-bold text-lg">B. What are proverbs?</p>
          <p>
            • &quot;A proverb is a saying that conveys a specific truth in a
            pointed, pithy way&quot; Proverbs are short sentences, drawn from
            long experience, or proverbs are moral truths or statements of
            wisdom that are written in a concise arrangement of one or two
            lines.
            <br />
            The book of Proverbs has wise sayings for everyone to read and
            follow. These sayings deal with many different problems and
            situations. Most of the proverbs are very short and easy to
            remember. The proverbs are not organised in a way that puts all the
            sayings on one topic together, Instead, almost every verse causes a
            new and important Idea.

            The purpose of Solomon&apos;s proverbs (Proverbs 1:2-6).{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We are informed by Solomon himself what was designed in writing the
            proverbs. It was:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li>To know wisdom and instructions.</li>
            <li>To discern the words of understanding.</li>
            <li>
              To enable those who read them to receive instructions in wise
              dealing.
            </li>
            <li>To give prudence to the simple.</li>
            <li>
              To give young men knowledge and instructions, so that the wise
              might hear and increase in learning, and those who understand
              might attain sound counsel.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The &quot;wisdom&quot; to which the wise man alluded included not
            only that knowledge which enables one to discover what is best in
            life but also that which directs to truth, enabling one to prepare
            for eternity. This is what the writer says: &quot;The fear of the
            lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and
            instruction&quot; (Proverbs 1:7). He then proceeds to give hundreds
            of practical examples of how to love according to godly wisdom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">The classes addressed to: </p>
          <p>
            It is noted that there are three classes involved in Solomon&quot;s
            design, each of which is provided with instructions adaptable to the
            need.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. To give prudence to the simple.</li>
            <li>2. To young men knowledge and discretion.</li>
            <li>3. To the men of understanding sound counsel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The &quot;simple&quot; are those unlearned and inexperienced but
            willing to learn &quot; <br />
            The &quot;young&quot; are those who by reason of youth are without
            training and self-control;
          </p>
          <p>
            ...and those of understanding - are men who, despite their nature,
            and attainment are still in need of instructions to effectively
            instruct orders. All of us, however wise and experienced, must
            refresh our stores of wisdom and learning from the only true source
            of wisdom - the Bible. In Proverbs 1:7-9, the wise man pointed out
            the way of wisdom. The first step of which is the fear of the Lord,
            this, it is said is the beginning of knowledge. The fear designated
            here is not terror, but such reverence for Jehovah that the one
            possessed shrinks from any deliberate disobedience of God&apos;s
            will and sinks ever to worship and serve God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second way to wisdom is by obedience to parents (prov1:8).
            &quot;My son, hear the instructions of thy father, and forsake not
            the law of thy mother&quot;. The pairing of the father&apos;s
            instructions and the mother&apos;s teaching alludes to the family as
            the place where wisdom and instructions first take place. The
            assumption is that parents with all the wisdom they possess will
            instruct their children and with all the authority they have control
            them for their good.

            against devious men and their foolish ways.
          </p>
          <p>The lure of sexual immorality with a forbidden woman.</p>
          <p>
            This parental teaching calls you, young men, to be saved through
            judgment for the glory of God. The parental Instructions announced
            the punishment that devious men who pursue foolish ways will meet
            with destruction. &quot;They lie in wait for their own blood; they
            set an ambush for their own lives (Prov 1:18).
          </p>

          <p>
            Wisdom is personified as crying out in the streets, and her verdict
            is that: &quot; The simple are killed by their turning away, and the
            complacency of fools destroy them (prov1:38). The father teaches his
            son(2:1) that &quot;no who go to the forbidden woman (2:16) come
            back, nor do they regain the path of life&quot; (2:19), and as for
            devious men, the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the
            treacherous will be rooted out of it&quot; (2: 22). These punishment
            come from Jehovah himself, &quot; for the devious person is an
            abomination to the Lord &quot; (3:32-33). The father teaches his son
            that the forbidden woman is - &quot; bitter and wormwood, Sharp has
            a two-edged sword her feet go down to death her steps follow the
            path to the steel&quot; (Prov 5:4-5).
          </p>

          <p>Those who go to the forbidden will not escape judgment. </p>
          <p>Jehovah hates the practice of the wicked (prov6:16). </p>
          <p> Inexorable is the judgment against adulterers (6:27-35)</p>
          <p>The fool who flirts with the forbidden woman (7:5-9) will pay. </p>
          <p>
            &quot; For many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are
            mighty throng, her house is the way to street, going down to the
            chambers of death&quot; (7:26-27).{" "}
          </p>
          <p>Wisdom should not be neglected but should be taught by parents</p>

          <p>
            She is personified as crying aloud in the street (1:20;21,8:1-3,9:3)
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the lord delighted in wisdom as he created the world (8:30).
          </p>
          <p>
            He who fails to find wisdom injures himself; all who hate wisdom
            love death(8:36)

            The book of Proverbs exists &quot;to give prudence to the
            simple&quot; (1:4), which is to say, to keep the simple from the
            punishment the book announces against wickedness.

            • The wise, through study, can attain unto &quot;sound counsel&quot;
            by which Solomon meant such learning as is conducive to man, best

            • There was much wisdom wrapped up in the proverbs, and Solomon
            would have his readers apply themselves so that they might learn
            these lessons and profit from them. The beginning and end of wisdom
            is to fear God and avoid evil (1:7,8:13,9:10,15:33). The world is a
            battleground between wisdom and folly, righteousness and wickedness,
