          <p className="font-bold text-lg">A. Introduction</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Paul, having told the Colossians that decrees of the law have been abolished and evil forces defeated, told Colossians not to feel obligated to follow these decrees nor be compelled to submit to man-made rules.</li>
            <li>	He started with “therefore,” meaning a conclusion based on the former statement, that they should look to Jesus to learn how to please God.</li>
            <li>As Christians they are to practice Christ teachings regardless of people&apos;s judgment.</li>
            <li>	They should not listen to anybody&apos;s judgment concerning the keeping of religious practices and rituals (2:16).</li>
            <li>	They should not be controlled by the regulation of the law.</li>
            <li>	The law had been taken away, and opposing forces defeated; they should enjoy the freedom in Christ.</li>
            <li>	They were not restricted to certain food or drink (Mark 7:19).</li>
            <li>	They were not to keep the Jewish festivals, observe the Jewish New Moon celebration, or be commanded to rest on the Sabbath.</li>
            <li>	They were free from all these ordinances and were not to be judged by others on these.</li>
            <li>	He stated Christian freedom on food that we should not judge one another anymore, Rom. 14:13a, Rom. 14:3,4; 1 Cor.10:29;1 Tim.4:3-5.</li>
            <li>	They have been liberated from keeping certain customs and traditions imposed by men.</li>
            <li>	They have the right to choose whether to practice or not.</li>
            <li>	They were to forgo any liberty that would make a fellow Christian fall away from faith. Rom.14:13-15, 19-21;1 Cor. 8:8-13.</li>
            <li>	V5 166, all things mentioned were shadows and not real.</li>
            <li>	Christian law was the true substance.</li>
            <li>	Heb.10:1, The shadow prepare way for the reality in Christ.</li>
            <li>	Paul was saying that Christians are not obligated to practice these customs because they were not matters of salvation.</li>
            <li>	The practice was to their discretion as long as it did not destroy the weak brother.</li>
            <li>	Paul listed five practices that Jews were obliged to observe, but Christians were not banned to keep.</li>
            <li>	Hos. 2:11, Ezek.45:17, listed these Jewish practices –&quot;feast&quot;, &quot;new moon&quot;, and &quot;Sabbath&quot;.</li>
            <li>	The five practices were included in the law.</li>
          </ul>        </div>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">B. The two categories are:</p>
          <p>
            1.	What is taken into the body
          </p>
          <p>
           2.	Observance of special Jewish festivals and days.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>These two practices have nothing to do with one&apos;s relationship with God.(Rom.12:1-3,1cor.6:19,20,2cor.7:1).</li>
            <li>	Food laws: lev.11:1-47, Deut.14:3-21, God listed what Israel could and could not eat.</li>
            <li>	Mark 7:18b,19, Acts 10:10-16, Christ did away with food laws.</li>
            <li>	1 Tim.4:1-4, Advocating abstinence from certain foods will be a sign of departure from faith.</li>
            <li>	Rom.14:5,6, 13-15,20,21, Christians have freedom of food.</li>
          </ul>
         
         <p>     On drink, not much is said in the law.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>	Lev.10:19, Priest were to abstain from wine or strong drink while in religious services</li>
            <li>	Numb.6:3, Those who took the Nazarite vow were to refrain from strong drink.</li>
            <li>	Judges 13:4,7,14 - Samson.</li>
            <li>	Prov. 20:1, Isa.5:11, 28:1, Over-indulgence condemned.</li>
          </ul>
         <p> <em>Feast: </em>  The laws mention observance of numerous obligatory feasts. Deut.16:16, 2 Chron.8:13.</p>
<p><em>Festival: </em>   They observed special days. Lev.23:23-25, numb.29:1-6; Day of Atonement Lev.16:3-34; 23:27-32; Jewish first month Ex.12:2, Called Nisan Esther 3:7; New moons observation on the first day of the month. Numb.10:10, 28:11; Psalm 81:3, Isa. 1:14, Ezek. 46:3.</p>

<p>Sabbath:      A day before the first 1st day of the week. Matt.28:1, Mk.16:1,2; Lk.23:56;24:1;John 20:1.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>	Sabbath means desist, &quot;cease from labour.&quot; No work allowed. Exo.20:8.</li>
        <li>	Heb. 8:13;10:9- Keeping the Sabbath is not for Christians</li>
        <li>	Matt.28:1-6; Mk.16:1-5, Lk.24:1-6 The Lord&apos;s Day is the day Christ arose.</li>
        <li>	Acts 20:7- The day Christians meet to remember him.</li>
      </ul>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>What Paul listed in col.2:16 had nothing to do with salvation and righteousness.</li>
            <li>	Food and observance of special days have no spiritual growth.</li>
            <li>	Jn.16:48- They were a shadow of the true food.</li>
            <li>	Matt.26:28- Christ's sacrifice is clean from sin.</li>
            <li>	Heb. 10:4- Sacrifices during feast and festivals of the law could not.</li>
            <li>	Heb.4:9; 1 Pet.1:3,4- We are promised eternal rest in heaven, better than Sabbath rest.</li>
            <li>Heb.3:3- Jesus a greater law-giver than Moses Heb.10:1-4.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
       <div className="space-y-2">
          <p className="font-bold text-lg ">Warnings:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Col.2:16- Warning against judging them.</li>
            <li>Col.2:18- Warning against defrauding them.</li>
            <li>Generally, we should not allow false teaching to defraud us of our benefit in Christ.</li>
            <li>Paul cautioned us not to be led away by false humility if they began to worship angels instead of Christ.</li>
            <li>Angel worship was practiced between AD182 and AD188</li>
            <li>Michael, the archangel, was widely worshiped from AD739</li>
            <li>Paul cautioned the Colossian if they worship angels, they will be robbed of their prizes, which are: Salvation, eternal life in heaven, and spiritual life in Christ.</li>
            <li>They were warned not to worship angels and any ritual worship.</li>
            <li>Eco.20:3-5- No object or any form or substance should be worshipped except God.</li>
         <li>Rev.19:10;22:8,9- Angel rejected John's worship at the island of Patmos</li>
         <li>They were warned not to turn away from reality in Christ and follow false teachers of ineffective shadow.  </li>
