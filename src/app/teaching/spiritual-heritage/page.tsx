            A. Paul showed a legacy of those who had been loyal to the Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years before Paul wrote 2 Timothy, God had laid hold of Saul of
            Tarsus on the road to Damascus. God told Saul that he was to be an
            Apostle to the gentiles, the kings as well as the children of Israel
            (Act9:15). Paul had a heritage for being thankful (Tim1:3). He
            learned about God from his ancestors, and he served God as a
            believer after a personal relationship with Christ. It was a
            blessing for Paul to have grown up a Jew with knowledge of Jehovah
            rather than as a pagan who served false God. After Paul became a
            Christian, he continued to serve God with the kind of wholehearted
            dedication that enabled him to say that he served God with a pure
            conscience (2 Tim1:3). Paul left us a commendable example of serving
            God faithfully, as well as a legacy of praying. He prayed for
            Timothy without ceasing

            B. Paul and Timothy, together in gospel.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul recalled Timothy`s spiritual heritage and wanted the young
            minister to remember it too. Timothy`s sincere faith had been
            nurtured in the fertile ground of a godly home. His grandmother,
            Lois and his mother Eunice were women of faith. Paul described their
            faith as an “unfeigned faith”. Paul’s word, ‘unfeigned’ could be
            translated `un-hypocritical`. It was sincere and genuine. Paul
            called Timothy, “my dearly beloved son” (2 Tim.1:2). We know that he
            nurtured him as a spiritual son. When he writes to others, he often
            tells what Timothy means to him (1 Cor. 4:17). When Timothy left his
            friend/mentor to go to Ephesus, he wept openly (2 Tim. 1:4) and,
            while apart, Paul longed for each other’s company. Paul readily
            expressed confidence in his younger colleague’s loyalty, usefulness
            and his concern for the churches. Timothy accompanied Paul during
            periods of his missionary journeys. Timothy had such a good
            reputation in Lystra that Paul recruited him to join the team (Acts
            16:1-3). Sometimes Timothy travelled with Paul, while at other times
            Paul moved on from a city, leaving Timothy behind to build up the
            believers (1 Tim. 1:3). Paul also would send Timothy to a church as
            personal messenger (1 Cor. 4:17, 1 Thess. 3:1-2), or summon Timothy
            to join him (2 Tim. 4:21). Timothy with others accompanied Paul on
            his way to Jerusalem after the third missionary journey. Timothy was
            with Paul in Rome during the latter’s house arrest, when he (Paul)
            wrote to Philemon. Timothy and Paul were also uniquely likeminded
            regarding their concern for the ministry and for the Churches (Phil.
            2:19-23). They formed an effective and faithful ministry team.

          <p className="font-bold text-lg">C. Stir up the gift (2 Tim. 1:6)</p>
          <p>
            Paul the elder warrior, knew the suffering and secret of
            faithfulness. The young Timothy needed encouragement in this
            precious character quality. So, Paul put Timothy in remembrance to
            stir up the gift that was in him by the laying of his hands (2
            Tim.1:6). The gift that Timothy possessed is not identified in
            scripture, so we cannot be sure what it was. Paul urged Timothy to
            stir up his gift as the one would make a fire burn brightly by
            stirring it. This likely didn`t mean Paul thought Timothy was
            neglecting or was in danger of forsaking the call by God. Rather
            Paul was challenging Timothy to take the kind of action that would
            prevent such things from happening. The imagery is that of
            constantly stirring the embers and replenishing fire in a fireplace
            to keep the fire blazing. ` Christian servants need to keep stirring
            up their memory of God`s grace and calling, so that the challenge of
            ministry will not dampen their devotion. Paul had told Timothy in an
            earlier letter not to neglect the gift that was given to him by
            prophecy (1 Tim. 4:4). Paul also knew Timothy’s personality and
            tendencies. His inner sprit needed encouragement, and Paul
            encouraged him not to be afraid. Fear should not keep us from
            exercising our abilities and fulfilling our ministry for Christ. In
            contrast to a spirit of fear, the Christian has been provided power,
            love and a sound Mind (2 Tim. 1:7).

            {" "}
            In verse 7, Paul was concerned that under the pressure of opposition
            Timothy might become afraid, hesitant, and ashamed of the gospel,
            causing his gift not to be properly exercised (1 Tim. 4:14). Varied
            influence could have contributed to a dry period for Timothy.{" "}

              • False teachers’ strife-oriented souls in Ephesus could break his
              spirit and push the young man into the world (1 Tim. 1:3,7,19,20;
              4:6-7; 2 Tim. 2:14-19,23).{" "}

              • Brethren were in some peril from the government, and a
              courageous stand for Christ would not be easy. Therefore,
              Timothy’s gift from God needed to be burnished so the flame would
              burn brightly.

            We must learn from this that a talent given from God can be either
            stiffed or stimulated by the response of the human will (Rom.12:1).
            Timothy needed to be aware that what God give to his children is the
            key to steadfastness. Paul reminded him that God has not given us a
            spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, love and discipline. Paul
            urged Timothy to share in suffering for the gospel by relying on the
            power of God. The family and parents are to teach their children
            spiritual and moral values and to lead them, through consistent
            lifestyle example and loving discipline, to make choices based on
            biblical truth (Acts 6:2, 6-7, Eph6:1-4)
